# SQL-Learning-and-Practice

A repository containing SQL scripts and queries from my hands-on learning journey. This includes examples covering a wide range of SQL concepts, such as:

- Database creation and management
- Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Query optimization
- Constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT)
- Functions (Aggregate functions, String functions, Date and Time functions)
- Transactions and auto-commit
- Practical use cases for learning SQL

These files demonstrate the concepts I have learned while practicing SQL and are useful for anyone looking for real-world SQL examples.

## File Structure

Each `.sql` file corresponds to a specific practice session or concept:

1. **Practice Session 1.sql** - Basics of SQL queries.
2. **Practice Session 2.sql** - Advanced SELECT queries.
3. **Practice Session 3.sql** - Advanced ALTER queries.
4. **Practice Session 4.sql** - Grouping and aggregation.
5. **Practice Session 5 (Commit and Auto Commit).sql** - Understanding transactions.
6. **Practice Session 5 (Current_date and Current_time).sql** - Using date and time functions.
7. **Practice Session 7 (CHECK).sql** - Using CHECK constraints.
8. **Practice Session 8 (DEFAULT).sql** - Using DEFAULT constraints.
